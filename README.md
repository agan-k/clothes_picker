# Clothes Picker

# Scenario

It’s 7am, you’ve been up since 6am. You had about 5 hours of sleep trough out the night because your toddler/preschooler had to go potty at 1am. At 4am they decided to jump in bed with you and continued sleeping while kicking your face every once in a while until 6:00 when the alarm went off. You are content because this describes somewhat successful night of sleep. You are downing the coffee and running into shower. You come out to the smell of burning eggs. You try to save the eggs while little Timmy is sitting in a puddle of milk. Cheerios and legos everywhere. His brother is coming out of the bathroom after doing the number two and he needs help cleaning up. You do that and you throw away the eggs, your breakfast. You manage to dress yourself but you are running late. Kids need to be dressed and they are still in their pajamas. You have no idea what the weather is like outside. You look trough the window. Seems like overcast. Is it raining? How cold is it? Do they need jackets or heavy coats? No idea. You open the “weather” app on your phone. Is 42°F cold? Is it windy? Whats’s the windchill? Is it raining? Timmy is soaked in milk, his brother needs to go number two again….

Ok, you open clothes_picker app, put in your zip code and the app displays the combination of clothes you need today. From head to toe. You grab the clothes, Dress the kids and you are out of the door. Late as always. But almost on time.

# Description

This app is geared towards parents with small children. Mornings are usually most hectic part of the day for the parents and picking the right clothes for the day can be challenging as they are trying to leave their home to drop off their little ones to day care, pre-K or kindergarten. Clothes picker app is designed to help reduce stress in this process and save few minutes of precious time.

The app will feature input field and the button. After the user inputs name of the city or the zip code the app will pick clothing combination based on the given weather conditions and display a gallery of images showing the clothing items in the order we put them on (i.e. pants, shirt, jacket, socks, shoes).

# API

Weather: https://openweathermap.org/api

# MVP

This App will be built using HTML, CSS and Javascript languages. It will implement an API to pull the data from source with Javascript. The user will call for a given location trough the input element which will return weather data. The logic of the program will create list of "weather conditions" which will be derived from the data and then coupled with the list of "clothing combinations". In additon to functinality, the app will be layed out and structured with HTML and styled with CSS using flexbox and/or grid.

# post MVP

The app at the moment works only with clothing combinations for boys. For the post MVP version I would need to survey some fellow parents with girls. This would add more variations and therefore more work with the logic. 
Another additon would be including the forecast in case the weather changes during the day and acordingly add more clothing items or accesories that would be useful for the corresponding weather condition.

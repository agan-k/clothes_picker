# Scenario

It’s 7am, you’ve been up since 6am. You had about 5 hours of sleep trough out the night because your toddler/preschooler had to go potty at 1am. At 4am they decided to jump in bed with you and continued sleeping while kicking your face every once in a while until 6:00 when the alarm went off. You are content because this describes somewhat successful night of sleep. You are downing the coffee and running into shower. You come out to the smell of burning eggs. You try to save the eggs while little Timmy is sitting in the puddle of milk. Cheerios and legos all over the floor. His brother is coming out of the bathroom after doing the number two and he needs help cleaning up. You do that and you throw away the eggs, your breakfast. You manage to dress yourself but you are running late. Kids need to be dressed and they are still in their pajamas. You have no idea what the weather is like outside. You look trough the window. Seems like overcast. Is it raining? How cold is it? Do they need jackets or heavy coats? No idea. You open the “weather” app on your phone. Is 42’F cold? Is it windy? Whats’s the windchill? Is it raining? Timmy is soaked in milk, his brother needs to go number two again….

Ok, you open clothes picker app, put in your zip code and the app displays the combination of clothes you need today. From head to toe. You grab the clothes, Dress the kids and you are out of the door. Late as always. But almost on time.
